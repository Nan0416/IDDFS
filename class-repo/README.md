# class-repo
The directory Search contains code relevant to the firs programming assignment.

The directory projectClasses contain generic classes to use to implement the set of algorithms and problems for the project.
Your team repo should be in the same directory as the class-repo, so that we can create scripts to automatically test your code.

For an example on how to set up your team repo and use these classes, clone the team-staff repo in the 4511 organization.
If your directories are set up properly, you should be able to run the solver.py script (currently, there is no solver function)
without modification to either your local class-repo or the team-staff repo.

We welcome comments and suggestions for improvement, but do keep in mind that there are multiple constraints the provided code needs to satisfy. 
* Modularity so that a problem class can be solved with a variety of algorithm implementations, including classic search, local search, and constraint satisfaction. 
* Starter code to speed up development, particularly for those students who have very little Python experience.
* Flexibility in the structure and holes in the implementation to give students some creative freedom and an interesting, educational assignment 
* Standardization in structure to aid testing and grading.
